OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:
LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
The Library Management System (LMS) project is designed to efficiently manage the resources available in a library, such as books, magazines, and DVDs. The system allows users (such as librarians or library staff) to perform various essential tasks, including adding new items to the library inventory, checking out and returning items, managing overdue fines, and searching for items based on different criteria (such as title, author, or category).This program will provide a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the system, offering essential functionalities to ensure that library operations are smooth, organized, and accurate.
